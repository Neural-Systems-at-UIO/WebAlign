**Setting up the work environment**
-----------------------------

- If you are interested in performing a complete online QUINT analysis, you can access WebAlign in the Rodent brain workbench https://rodent-brain-workbench.apps.hbp.eu/ 

- If you want to access the online registration tool WebAlign separately, you can create a private collab in the EBRAINS collaboratory.

-Register for an EBRAINS account, login, and set up a private collab.

-Initialise the Bucket by clicking on Bucket in the navigation panel -> Create Bucket.

-Give users Admin, Editor or Viewer rights by clicking Team in the navigation panel.

-Install WebAlign from the EBRAINS Collaboratory App Store.

   1. To install Collaboratory Apps, click on the + Create button (top right corner). 
   2. Give the page a Title (for example, WebAlign), select the Community App option, and click Create.
   3. Select the App to install (for example, WebAlign), and click Save and View.
